The app works by adding a button to each story in the current story list on Pivotal Tracker. By clicking this button, you can choose the date, project, task, how many hours and add extra notes. This will be submitted to Freshbooks, displaying the story's name, as well as your extra notes. The button will also update to display the total time spent on the story. The information is stored on tasks on Pivotal Tracker, which can be edited. The editing of the tasks on Pivotal Tracker will not reflect in your time entries on Freshbooks for security reasons.
